# Project Euler

## Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of mathematics."

This directory contains my ongoing work on Project Euler - an online recreational  series of mathematical challenges. The challenges begin at a level that is relatively simple and (generally) increase in complexity/difficulty.

The challenges are presented as straightforward maths puzzles, and on initial inspection do not have any necessity to use code in order to solve them; however there is a strong suggestion that using code is the best way to tackle these.

By using code to solve these problems my aim is to develop my efficiency and skill at approaching logical problems, to improve my problem solving process, to better understand how to break problems down into smaller parts, and to produce an efficient and clean codebase.

I initially intend to approach each puzzle with a view simply to solve it, before trying to make the program more efficient. I intend to do my best to follow the DRY principle; which is expected to include using 'older' functions when similar logic is required.
